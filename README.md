# disaster-board (subject name update) 
This project was initialized as part of IBM's Call for Code 2019 challenge. The Call for Code is an annual challenge that asks
developers to create an application that is designed to help people in need. The 2019 challenge asks developers to create an 
application that helps people either during or in the aftermath of a natual disaster.

My application is a simple way for people in a community to check in, allowing family members to know that they are accounted
for. Disaster Board is also a way for people to signal for help and simply specify the level of urgency, the danger they are
facing and what they need. 

The hope is that the application or one like it is adopted by city or county governments or public safety organizations and
gives the option to enroll for the application using home ownership title or automobile registration. There will also be a
voluntary enrollment option. 

The navbar will contain simple options with dropdowns but the main page will be where options will be large and easy to
read and navigate if needed. But the purpose is to limit navigation for those who require assistance immediately.

For the lowest level of urgency, users can post their status by simply clicking a button on the application that says 
"I'm Okay!" (subject name update). Using the account information the application posts their name to a central board that is 
searchable by name. The user can opt to display their address to limit any confusion caused by similar names. The information 
can be pre-populated to automatically display or users may opt to complete information by creating a message if they want 
to communicate to friends, family or authorities.

The next level of urgency is "Need Help Soon" (subject name update) which indicates that the user is okay but anticipates 
needing assistance in the near future. Pop up descriptions will be easily editable so directing agencies can choose those 
most apporopriate for their specific community's needs. Examples are "water rising", "need water soon", "need food soon",
"first-aid for non life-threatening injuries", "shelter compromised", "car stalled", etc.Users will also have the option to 
create a message that best describes their personal situation. Phone GPS will automatically be turned on when this option 
is clicked to help public safety professionals locate user. App will ask user for update every 15 minutes to determine
if user's status has changed. Status will populate on central board. Public safety will also be
able to access central board to show user alert has been acknowledged. Alert can be changed to "I'm Okay" 
by user if issue has been resolved or by public safety. 

The next level of urgency is "Help!" which means user is in need of help immediately. As with previous alerts, status will 
update on central board without requiring additional input. Again, GPS will automatically be turned, 911 will be 
called and speaker on phone will be engaged in an attempt to create direct contact with user to get more information. The 
built in flashlight will automatically be turned on to help responders better locate user. (Not sure about this  the 
flashlight and speaker function as it could potentially create more risk for user). 

There will be both mobile and desktop versions. There will be accessibility options such as voice command and mobility adaptations.

The data collected from pop up options will be used to determine initial disaster need. While the developers of this app are aware there will be discrepancies again, the data can be used as an initial estimation tool to help start relief efforts.
